A simple React app that takes an image and finds its top 6 colors to change the body background and offer the colors as swatches.

Uses react-color-extractor for the extraction.

This was a research idea to see how this could work in practice. The app is client-side since there is not need to a server to parse or store the images.

It's a litter verbose right now, and the CSS is a mess, but it does the job.
